matrix is a simple implementation of ncurses, that displays
falling matrix code in the users terminal.

It works best with unicode terminals, or the colours will 
appear incorrect.

Compiling:
Now using premake4 to build the project. Though it's pretty small... you can probably just use plain old gcc. ;)

1. cmake .
2. make
3. ./matrix

Options:

Try ./matrix (red|green|blue|grey).


Enjoy.
